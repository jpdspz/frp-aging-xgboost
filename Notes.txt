- Increase model complexity (increase max_depth and n_estimators,
    reduce regularization) to improve both training and validation learning curves (OK)

Next steps
- Test model with residual modulus as target property instead of modulus retention
- Test inclusion of secondary features (currently removed)
- Implement early_stopping_rounds
- Research model ensembling and polynomial features
