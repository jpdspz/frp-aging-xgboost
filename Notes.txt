- Remove transverse, shear, and mass uptake tabs from dataset spreadsheet
- Create new tab for holdout data
- Use Rosa et al. (2024) as holdout data to assess long-term extrapolation
- Assess sensitivity of residual modulus to changing profile thicknes (no.linspace(2, 20, 50))
    - If curve plateaus, thickness becomes negligible (use 10 mm)
    - If linear trend, continue with caution (apply physic-based scaling)
    - If erratic, avoid extrapolation and use worst-case 10 mm properties

No longer necessary (model not overfitting):
- Test polynominal features (e.g., exposure time x average temperature)
- Research model ensembling
- Implement early_stopping_rounds
