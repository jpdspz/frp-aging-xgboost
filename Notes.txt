test: add secondary features back to dataset

- Added categorical (type of resin, type of fiber, manuf. process) and continuous (pH, RH, temp. range) features back to the dataset
- Add residual analysis features to Predictor class

Next steps
- Merge fix-underfitting-1 with main
- Test model without log-transforming exposure time
- Assess sensitivity of residual modulus to changing profile thicknes (no.linspace(2, 20, 50)))
    - If curve plateaus, thickness becomes negligible (use 10 mm)
    - If linear trend, continue with caution (apply physic-based scaling)
    - If erratic, avoid extrapolation and use worst-case 10 mm properties
- Test polynominal features (e.g., exposure time x average temperature)
- Research model ensembling
- Implement early_stopping_rounds
