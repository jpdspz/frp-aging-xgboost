chore: update training and holdout datasets

- Used data compiled by Liu et al. (2020) as holdout data

Results:
    - Very good looking prediction time series and learning curves



- Update residuals vs. actuals method to plot with custom settings


- Change article used as holdout and check prediction time series with experimental

Next steps:
    - Check sensitivity of prediction time series to changes in thickness (one of the most important features)
    


- Assess sensitivity of residual modulus to changing profile thicknes (np.linspace(2, 20, 50))
    - If curve plateaus, thickness becomes negligible (use 10 mm)
    - If linear trend, continue with caution (apply physic-based scaling)
    - If erratic, avoid extrapolation and use worst-case 10 mm properties
