chore: update benchmark model

- Removed Arrhenius-related features (it was confirmed previously that the degradation is not Arrhenius-like)
- Removed feature weights, interaction constraints, and log_transform to check if they are important for prediction time series
- Updated output functions based on latest versions of the model (Bayesian optmization convergence plots, MAPE metrics etc.)
- Increased the number of trained models from 4 to 10 to evaluate the standard deviation of prediction time series



- Update residuals vs. actuals method to plot with custom settings


- Change article used as holdout and check prediction time series with experimental

Next steps:
    - Check sensitivity of prediction time series to changes in thickness (one of the most important features)
    
- Test data from Liu et al. (2022) as holdout data

- Assess sensitivity of residual modulus to changing profile thicknes (np.linspace(2, 20, 50))
    - If curve plateaus, thickness becomes negligible (use 10 mm)
    - If linear trend, continue with caution (apply physic-based scaling)
    - If erratic, avoid extrapolation and use worst-case 10 mm properties
