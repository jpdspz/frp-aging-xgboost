# XGBoost-based prediction of residual properties of aged FRP composites

This repository contains preliminary code, datasets, and additional resources for an ongoing study on the long-term dynamic performance of a pultruded GFRP structure subjected to high humidity, moderate temperature, and mildly alkaline conditions. The work builds upon the framework proposed by [Liu, Liu, and Feng (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263822322000022). Feedback and collaboration are welcome as results are being refined.
